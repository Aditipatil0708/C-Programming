C Programming & System-Level Concepts Repository

This repository contains well-structured C programs and implementations of core system-level programming concepts. The code focuses on performance, memory management, and efficient execution, making it ideal for freshers, learners, and interview preparation.

🔹 Key Concepts Covered

Multi-paradigm concepts including multitasking, multiprocessing, multithreading, multiprogramming, and multi-core execution to understand concurrent and parallel programming.

Core C programming fundamentals such as data types, arrays, strings, storage classes, scope, lifetime, and linkage of variables.

Memory management techniques including dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free) and internal memory flow.

Advanced data handling using structures, unions, enumerations, and optimized memory layouts.

File handling in C covering character, string, and block-level input/output operations.

Pointer-based programming including pointer arithmetic, void pointers, function pointers, arrays of pointers, and pointer to arrays.

Low-level execution concepts such as stack frames, function calling mechanisms, return techniques, and memory alignment.

Preprocessor and macros including conditional compilation, header file usage, tokenization, pragma directives, and bitfields.
